	OLMenu - A menu-driven offline reader system for uqwk

Thanks for using OLMenu!

OLMenu will simplify the use of uqwk for handling mail and news by 
allowing individual and system users to configure and execute uqwk from 
an easy-to-use menu.

If you are installing OLMenu for personal use, unzip the olmenu.zip file
in your $HOME directory. Enter "olmenu" without the quotes to start OLMenu.
Read olmenu.howto for information about running OLMenu (may be accessed
while running olmenu by entering h from any menu).

If you are installing OLMenu on a system for multiple users, unzip 
the olmenu.zip file in a convenient location, then read olmenu.setup 
for instructions on setting up OLMenu on a system.

Also included in the package is SONR - Simple Offline News/mail Reader. 
SONR is a simplified menu-based script for SOUP format packets only which
is fast and efficient if no configuration capabilities are required by the 
users. See the readme.sonr file in sonr101.zip for more details.

The latest versions of OLMenu and SONR are always available via anonymous 
ftp from: america.net in the /pub/users/kgresham/ directory.

Thanks, and enjoy OLMenu!
