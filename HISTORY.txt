uqwk 2.21 (js, 10/25/2001)

- Rewrote a little part of the signal handling/error returning code

uqwk 2.20 (js, 10/24/2001)

- More bugfixed, most related to maildir and signal handling,
  as proposed by Jos en Bekker.

uqwk 2.19 (js, 10/23/2001)

- Fixed a bug when SUBSCRIBEing to a group, an offline command;
  with no connection to the server, this would still result
  in attempts to communicate with it.  Thanks, Jos den Bekker!

uqwk 2.18 (js, 10/05/2001)

- Fixed a bug where uqwk closed an already closed file handle,
  causing SIGSEGV's on some platforms, thanks to Konstantin
  Isakov and Peter Karlsson.

uqwk 2.17 (js, 04/19/2001)

- Fixed a one-off error in a mail reading error message, thanks to
  Jos den Bekker.

uqwk 2.16 (js, 06/21/2000)

- Fixed a bug that broke compilation without NNTP support, as noted
  by Peter Karlsson.  Thanks, Peter!

uqwk 2.15 (js, 01/03/2000)

- Applied Doug Kaufman's patches.  Thanks, Doug!

uqwk 2.14 (js, 10/19/1999)

- Included Helmut Karlowski's modifications to ignore errors on opening
  articles.  Thanks, Helmut!
- Brought the manual page up to date.

uqwk 2.13 (js, 09/11/1999)

- Fixed an NNTP command that accidentally carried a newline too much
  (causing existing groups to be reported as nonexistent in the worst
  case).  Thanks to Jeff Schroeder.

uqwk 2.12 (js, 07/15/1999)

- Fixed a nasty bug in SLNP (SOUP) mail reply handling in which article
  length was determined incorrectly

uqwk 2.11 (js, 05/20/1999)

- Several small changes to make uqwk compiler cleaner than ever
  (thanks mainly to George Schwarz)

uqwk 2.10 (js, 05/14/1999)

- Put under `configure' control
- Made to compile cleanly (even when being pedantic)

uqwk 2.09 (js, 05/12/1998)

- More code cleanup
- Preempted nonexisting MSG files from addition to the AREAS file (SOUP mode)
  (thanks to George Schwarz for pointing this out and testing)

uqwk 2.08 (js, 03/07/1998)

- Finished(?) maildir support; thanks to Jos den Bekker for code
  revision, contribution and testing.

uqwk 2.07 (js, 03/04/1998)

- Rudimentary maildir support
- Preparations for full maildir support
- Some cleanup

uqwk 2.06 (js, 06/02/1998)

- Removed obsolete (unused) code from misc.c

uqwk 2.05 (js, 05/25/1998)

- Tiny modification (due to a change in GNKSAlib's API)

uqwk 2.04 (js, 03/26/1998)

- fixes a summary mode bug (news.c) that somehow crept in along
  the way (thanks to Doug Kaufman for the report and the fix).

uqwk 2.03 (js, 02/16/1998)

- fixed an (ancient, yet unnoticed all this time...) bug in appending
  messages (both mail and news) to QWK "messages.dat" files.

uqwk 2.02 (js, 02/09/1998)

- fixed a tiny bug in init.c/close.c: when processing replies only,
  NNTP connections were opened/closed unnecessarily (NNTP uqwk only)

uqwk 2.01 (js, 01/06/1998)

- added basic status reporting when fetching mail

uqwk 2.0 (js, 12/16/1997 -- final version)

- updated to reflect MANKSA name (and interface) change
  (MANKSA is now (again) GNKSA, the Good Net-Keeping Seal of Approval)
- extensive acceptance testing in real life situations, no problems
  found -- so it went final.  Finally.

uqwk 2.0fc4 (js, 11/12/1997 -- fourth final candidate version)

- rnews batches (== SOUP newsgroup files) contain `indexes'
  which are _almost_ the article byte length -- almost, because
  line termination counts as a single byte, even if represented
  by multiple.
  When news articles -- they shouldn't, but sometimes do somehow --
  contain \r\n line termination, uqwk used a wrong index (the
  file size of the article instead of the size with the number
  of \r's subtracted).
  uqwk now makes excruciatingly sure that articles are written to
  the SOUP files in Unix format, with '\n' line termination,
  and correct article indexing in them.
- a few other (minor) fixes in news.c's error handling

uqwk 2.0fc2 (js, 10/22/1997 -- second final candidate version)

- changed (enhanced) control over message validation (-Vn switch)
- worked around a few bugs occurring in a particular Unix version
  better left unmentioned.

uqwk 2.0fc1 (js, 10/21/1997 -- first final candidate version)

- A few (very minor) cleanups in reply.c
- Rethought some of the GNKSA validation decisions
  (and adapted the man page accordingly)

uqwk 2.0b7 (js, 10/13/1997 -- seventh beta version)

- Updated calls to gnksalib routines

uqwk 2.0b6 (js, 10/07/1997 -- sixth beta version)

- Fixed (usually spurious) extra `group' (directly after FindActive()
  in DoGroup in NNTP mode
- Fixed one more instance of a conference being created before testing
  whether the group actually exists
- Reorganized/cleaned up a bit in news.c

uqwk 2.0b5 (js, 10/06/1997 -- fifth beta version)

- SOUP mode: a .MSG file was created, even for non-existing groups -- fixed
- fixed a fclose() on a possibly null filehandle (crashing bug)
- Updated the man page, and the getsoup script, for decent mailbox locking
  strategies, and some information about it

uqwk 2.0b4 (js, 10/06/1997 -- fourth beta version)

- Small robustness patch, and enhanced user feedback in the
  offline command handling functions (once again, thanks Jos den Bekker)

uqwk 2.0b3 (js, 10/03/1997 -- third beta version)

- More fixes in the mail handling part (again, thanks to Jos den Bekker)

uqwk 2.0b2 (js, 10/01/1997 -- second beta version)

- Fixes in offline.c's OffLine function (reported and fixed
  by Jos den Bekker <josdb@xs4all.nl>

uqwk 2.0b1 (js, 09/30/1997 -- first beta version)

- Calls sendmail directly when mailing, in _all_ cases (sometimes,
  "mail" was used, sometimes sendmail)
- Fixed a few bugs w.r.t. returning errorcodes
- Added `-I/path/to/inews' switch and global variables containing
  the inews path as well as a full inews call (/path/to/inews -h);
  removed `INEWS_WRAPPER' compile option.  Added UQ_INEWS_PATH
  environment variable
- Added (basic) message validation support (GNKSA, using gnksalib)
- Added `+V', `-V' switches (and `UQ_VALIDATE' environment var)
  to enable/disable message validation
- Added a warning message against using QWK mode (Usenet message
  headers get maimed when using the QWK format)
- Updated the man page

Note: at present, `gnksalib' is preliminary, and under development.

uqwk1.8++ (js, 08/26/97 -- intermediate version):

- NNTP version does not fetch entire active file, but uses the GROUP command
  to obtain group article counts (big performance win)
- Fixed scoring bugs (group score rules lingered on...)
- Fixed bugs in NNTP buffer lengtht
- Fixed bugs writing .newsrc files
- Added errorchecking, -handling en -returning throughout the program

  and `-?' (identical to `-p').

- Fixed fclose() of non-open file in close.c which caused core dumps.
- Properly define sum_flag in uqwk.h to keep compilers happy.

- artnum problem in NNTP code fixed, caused core dumps.
- CR's causing off-by-one error in offline processing, fixed.
